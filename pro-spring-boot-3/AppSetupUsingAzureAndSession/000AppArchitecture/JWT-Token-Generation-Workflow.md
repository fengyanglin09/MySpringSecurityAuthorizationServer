JWT Token Generation Workflow
User Authentication:

The user attempts to log in through the Angular frontend.
Angular redirects the user to Azure Entra ID's login page (via OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect protocols).
Azure Entra ID Authenticates the User:

The user enters their credentials on the Azure Entra ID login page.
Azure Entra ID verifies the credentials and, upon successful authentication, generates a JWT token (usually an ID token and/or access token).
JWT Token Sent to Angular:

After authentication, Azure Entra ID redirects the user back to the Angular application with the token(s) included in the redirect response.
Token Storage in Angular:

Angular stores the JWT token (e.g., in localStorage or cookies) for subsequent API requests.
JWT Token Sent to Spring Boot Backend:

Angular sends the token in the Authorization: Bearer <JWT> header when making requests to the Spring Boot backend.
Spring Boot Backend Validates the Token:

The Spring Boot backend does not generate or manage the token but validates it.
The backend uses Azure Entra ID's public JWK (JSON Web Key) endpoint to verify the token's signature and ensure its validity (e.g., expiration, issuer, audience).
Key Components and Responsibilities
Azure Entra ID (Authorization Server):

Generates JWT tokens (access tokens and ID tokens).
Provides an endpoint for public keys (JWKs) to validate token signatures.
Manages user authentication and authorization flows.
Angular Frontend:

Handles user login redirection to Azure Entra ID.
Stores the JWT token securely after login.
Includes the token in API requests to the Spring Boot backend.
Spring Boot Backend:

Validates the JWT token's authenticity and claims.
Enforces access control based on the token's claims (e.g., roles, scopes).
Processes the user's request if the token is valid.
Example Token Validation in Spring Boot
Using Spring Security in the backend, the JWT token can be validated as follows:

Add Dependencies: Include dependencies for Spring Security and OAuth 2.0 Resource Server:

xml
Copy code
<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server</artifactId>
</dependency>
Configuration: Configure the resource server to validate tokens:

java
Copy code
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
http
.csrf().disable()
.authorizeRequests()
.antMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()
.anyRequest().authenticated()
.and()
.oauth2ResourceServer()
.jwt();
}
}
Set Azure Entra ID JWK Endpoint: In your application.yml or application.properties:

yaml
Copy code
spring:
security:
oauth2:
resourceserver:
jwt:
issuer-uri: https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/v2.0
Replace {tenant-id} with your Azure Entra ID tenant's ID.

Token Validation:

Spring Security automatically retrieves the signing keys from Azure's JWK endpoint and validates the token's signature.
Claims (e.g., user roles, scopes) can be extracted and used for authorization.
Why Doesn't Spring Boot Generate the JWT?
In this architecture:

Azure Entra ID is the trusted identity provider responsible for issuing tokens.
Delegating token generation to Azure ensures centralized and secure user authentication.
Spring Boot's role is to validate and use the token to enforce security in API endpoints.
