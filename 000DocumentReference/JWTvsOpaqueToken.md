<h2> JSON Web Token(JWT) vs Opaque Token </h2>

<p>
Authentication is the method of deciding if, in fact, someone or something is who or what it claims itself to be. Authentication technology offers device access control by testing to see whether a userâ€™s credentials match the credentials in an authenticated user database or in a server for data authentication. Token-based authentication works by ensuring that a signed token is followed by each request to a server, which the server verifies for validity and responds to the request only then. A token is a piece of data that has little meaning or use on its own, but becomes a crucial player in securing the application in accordance with the correct tokenization method.
